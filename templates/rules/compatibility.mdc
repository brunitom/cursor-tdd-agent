## Cross-Model Compatibility and Safety

- Default to concise, bullet-first answers. Expand only when explicitly asked.
- Do not reveal private chain-of-thought. Provide only brief justifications and the final answer.
- Prefer referencing `memory-bank/` files over restating their content.

### Length Targets (soft caps)
- ASSESS: keep output skimmable; target ≤ 200 lines. Link to `memory-bank/assessment.md` for full details.
- PLAN: target ≤ 150 lines. Prioritize the Test Matrix and Minimal Implementation Strategy.
- ACT: target ≤ 120 lines (outside of edits). Prefer minimal diffs and citations over large code pastes.

### Citations and Code Handling
- When referencing repository code, cite files and ranges rather than pasting long code blocks.
- For code not in the repository, use fenced code blocks with the appropriate language tag.
- When proposing edits, minimize the diff scope and avoid unrelated formatting changes.

### Post-Edit Discipline (ACT)
- After performing edits, run tests/lints/build where applicable, summarize results briefly, and fix failures before proceeding.
- Keep the red → green loop tight; prefer smallest steps that restore green.

### Safety and Licensing
- Never output secrets, credentials, or tokens. Sanitize any logs or configs before displaying.
- Do not copy proprietary code from external sources. Generate original implementations or cite permissible references.

### Model Style Adaptation
- If the model tends toward long narratives (e.g., deliberate styles), compress to bullets and link to `memory-bank/` details.
- If the model is terse, ensure clarity with short, well-structured lists and explicit file references.
