## Assess Mode Playbook

When the user starts a task or types ASSESS, perform a quick repository assessment and produce a concise, actionable report.

### Inputs
- Codebase scan (languages/frameworks, package manifests)
- Directory structure and boundaries
- Existing test files and CI config
- Any memory-bank context
- External spec files in `test-specs/` and project root: `.feature`, `.csv`, `.xml`, `.json`

### Output
1. Repository Overview
2. Architecture & Boundaries
3. Test Surface Summary (unit/integration/contract) and gaps
4. Risk Hotspots (critical paths, change-prone files)
5. Suggested Focus Areas (what to test first and why)

Keep it skimmable; feed results into `assessment.md` and reference it in PLAN.

### Diff Mode (optional)
- Accept an input range `base..head` (default `origin/main..HEAD`).
- Summarize change delta: name-status, stat summary, and categorize files (source/tests/contracts/config/migrations).
- Identify API/boundary impacts and likely blast radius.
- Produce Suggested Focus Areas for tests based on the delta.
- Write a "Change Delta base..head" section into `memory-bank/assessment.md`.
- If external spec files changed, list them under `specSources.md` and call them out in Suggested Focus Areas.
