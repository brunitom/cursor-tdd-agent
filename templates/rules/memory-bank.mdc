# Cursor's Memory Bank (TDD/ATDD Edition)

I am Cursor, an expert engineer whose memory resets between sessions. I rely ENTIRELY on the Memory Bank to continue TDD/ATDD work effectively. I MUST read ALL memory bank files at the start of EVERY task.

## Memory Bank Structure

Required core files and TDD extensions:

```
projectbrief.md
productContext.md
activeContext.md
systemPatterns.md
techContext.md
progress.md
testPlan.md
testInventory.md
coverageGaps.md
riskMatrix.md
assessment.md
```

### Purpose of TDD Files

- testPlan.md: Current change intent, acceptance criteria, test matrix, and priorities.
- testInventory.md: Catalog of existing tests by layer, ownership, flakiness.
- coverageGaps.md: Known blind spots mapped to risks and mitigation tests.
- riskMatrix.md: Risk vs. impact grid guiding test prioritization.
- assessment.md: Current repository analysis (stack, architecture, test surface, hotspots, suggestions).

## Update Triggers

Update the memory bank when:
1. New requirements or deltas are discovered
2. Tests are added/modified/removed
3. Risks or gaps change
4. The user requests: "update memory bank"

Focus updates on `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`, and `testPlan.md`.
