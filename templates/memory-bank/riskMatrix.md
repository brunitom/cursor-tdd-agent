# Risk Matrix

| Risk Area | Impact (H/M/L) | Likelihood (H/M/L) | Suggested Tests | Mitigation |
| --------- | -------------- | ------------------ | --------------- | ---------- |
|           |                |                    |                 |            |

## Heuristics

- High impact or high likelihood => Must have tests.
- Unknown behavior => add characterization tests first.
